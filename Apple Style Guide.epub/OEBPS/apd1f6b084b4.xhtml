This chapter provides guidelines and tips for how you can write consciously to include everyone.</p></div><div class="Alert"><p class="Note"><em>Note: </em>Guidance about inclusive writing may change over time, so check back for updates. Also keep in mind that inclusive language may vary slightly in different locales, so you may need to adapt the principles here to the unique needs of your language or region.</p></div></article><article id="apd91d6c2458"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h2>General guidelines</h2><div id="apd5fe02a5bb" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Think inclusively.</h3><p>As you write, think about your potential audience, and try to imagine your content from their perspective. Will the words and phrases you use be understood by everyone? Do these words and phrases have any harmful or negative associations?</p></div><p>Keep in mind that words can sometimes carry meanings you don’t intend. Be open to learning about the impact of language, and be respectful of those who may receive words differently from how you intended them.</p></div></div><div id="apda3f808b78" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Research words.</h3><p>Investigating the history and usage of a word can help you decide whether to use it. For example, some common expressions (like <em>grandfathered in</em>) arose from oppressive or exclusionary contexts. If you’re unsure about a word or expression, be sure to research both how it originated and how it’s understood by people now.</p></div></div><div id="apdc9030fb98" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Consider the context.</h3><p>Even if a common word has one negative use that you should avoid, it may still be acceptable in other contexts. For example, although it’s inappropriate to use <em>mute</em> to refer to a person who is nonspeaking, it’s OK to use it to refer to silencing a device. Take context into account when making wording decisions.</p></div></div><div id="apd480802a97" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Avoid terms that are violent, oppressive, or ableist.</h3><p>Don’t describe technology using terms that are inherently violent—like <em>kill</em> or <em>hang</em>. Don’t use the terms <em>master</em> and <em>slave</em>, which describe an oppressive human relationship. Finally, don’t use terms like <em>sanity check</em>, which associates mental health with being functional.</p></div><p>In general, it’s a good idea to avoid describing software or hardware using human or biological attributes; doing so can lead to unintended hurtful implications.</p></div><div id="apd113aad2be" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Avoid idioms and colloquial expressions.</h3><p>Common sayings—like <em>fall through the cracks</em>, <em>on the same page</em>, or <em>backseat driver</em>—can add flavor to writing, but they can also be difficult to understand for people who are learning the language. If your content is localized, using phrases like these can also make it more difficult to translate.</p></div></div><div id="apdcd342be16" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Don’t use color to convey positive or negative qualities.</h3><p>Avoid assigning good and bad values to colors (for example, <em>blacklist</em>, <em>white hat hacker</em>, or <em>red team hacker</em>) or using colors as metaphors to convey larger concepts. Use colors only to describe actual colors (for example, <em>black text on a white background</em>, <em>the white point of a display</em>).</p></div></div><div id="apdf2ad8ef15" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Err on the side of caution.</h3><p>If you’re not sure about a term, but you believe it might be questionable based on your research or feedback from others, then choose a different term. The beauty of language is that there’s usually a term that expresses the meaning you want to convey just as well—or even more clearly.</p></div></div></article><article id="apd7a037f274"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h2>Inclusive representation</h2><p>Remember that the people who use Apple products have a broad variety of life experiences, cultures, and backgrounds. When your content depicts people—real or fictional—make sure to represent the diversity of the world.</p></div><div id="apd8696c918b" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Use diverse names as examples.</h3><p>Sometimes you may use names as examples. Include names that reflect a variety of ethnicities and genders.</p></div><div class="Example"><p><em>Given name examples:</em> Blair, Étienne, Guillermo, Lee, Mayuri, Priyanka, Shannon, Yen</p><p><em>Family name examples:</em> Kawashima, Lai, McNeil, Melnykova, Salinas, Sears, Zhao</p></div><p>Also keep in mind that some cultures don’t use a Western-style name structure (given name followed by a family name). In addition, some cultures may use multiple family names. Try to reflect this diversity in your examples.</p></div><div id="apd728c80250" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Avoid biases and stereotypes.</h3><p><em>Bias</em> is a tendency to think and behave in ways that are favorable (or unfavorable) to certain people or communities. Be aware of ways your content may unintentionally reinforce biases, and consciously work to avoid doing so. For example:</p></div><ul><li><p>If your content uses text or imagery to depict people in certain occupations or settings, include a variety of ethnicities, genders, ages, body types, and abilities.</p></li><li><p>If your content mentions examples of holidays, foods, or sports, don’t just give examples from Western culture.</p></li><li><p>Avoid using examples that reflect primarily an affluent lifestyle.</p></li></ul><p>A <em>stereotype</em> is a fixed belief about people or groups based on identifying characteristics, like gender, race, physical capability, or age. Avoid stereotypes in how people are presented in your content. For example, don’t only represent a <em>family</em> as a woman, a man, and their biological children; remember to include a variety of family types.</p></div></article><article id="apd2a7af8d36"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h2>Gender identity</h2><p>Avoid binary representations of gender when you can reword using gender-neutral language.</p></div><div class="Example"><p><em>Avoid:</em> Hiring men and women of diverse backgrounds fosters a culture of innovation.</p><p><em>Preferable:</em> Hiring people of diverse backgrounds fosters a culture of innovation.</p></div><p>It’s OK to refer to specific genders if the context requires it.</p><div class="Example"><p>The percentage of women in the workforce has increased.</p><p>Women should earn the same as men for comparable work.</p></div><div id="apd141f2d6c3" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Use gender-neutral pronouns.</h3><p>Don’t use gender-specific pronouns (such as <em>he</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>he or she</em>, and so on) to refer to people of unspecified gender. Instead, it’s OK to use <em>they</em>, <em>their</em>, or <em>them</em> as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun.</p></div><div class="Example"><p><em>Correct:</em> A subscriber can post their recipes to your shared folder.</p><p><em>Incorrect:</em> A subscriber can post his or her recipes to your shared folder.</p></div><p>You can also avoid gender-specific pronouns by rewriting a sentence—for example, using the plural form of the noun (<em>subscribers can post their recipes</em>), or simply omitting the pronoun (<em>a subscriber can post recipes</em>).</p><p>If you refer to a specific person, don’t make assumptions about which pronouns to use based on the person’s name or appearance. If you’re unsure how to refer to someone, you can ask them. Individuals may go by <em>he/him</em>, <em>she/her</em>, <em>they/them</em>, other pronouns, or no pronouns.</p></div><div id="apdc977ce702" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Use gender-neutral titles and honorifics when appropriate.</h3><p>Some people may choose to use a gender-neutral title (such as <em>Mx.</em>). If you’re writing content about (or addressed to) a real person, and your style requires you to include a title, ask the person what title they use. If you can’t ask them, consider adopting a style that refers to people using only their name.</p></div></div></article><article id="apd49cbb2b06"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h2>Writing about disability</h2><p>When you write about people with disabilities, focus on each individual’s accomplishments, personality, authentic story, or message. You may not even need to mention someone’s disability unless it’s essential to the content; if you do refer to someone’s disability, follow the guidelines below.</p></div><div id="apdacca8953a" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Understand when to use identity-first or person-first language.</h3><p>People who consider a disability or neurodivergence to be part of their identity may prefer <em>identity-first language</em>, which places an emphasis on culture: <em>A Deaf person</em>, <em>an autistic person</em>.</p></div><p>Others may prefer <em>person-first language</em>, which emphasizes the individual first, then their disability: <em>A person who is deaf or hard of hearing</em>, <em>a person on the autism spectrum</em>.</p><p>Preferences for identity-first and person-first language vary; when writing about specific individuals or groups, always ask them how they prefer to be identified.</p><p>For advice about specific terms, see <a href="apd1f6b084b4.xhtml#apd570a90cf4" class="xRef Subhead">A guide to terms about disability</a>, below.</p></div><div id="apdcb3f5d70f" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Acknowledge a wide range of disability.</h3><p>It’s helpful to think about disability on a spectrum. For example, with blindness, there’s a wide range of vision differences—from people who are born blind, to those with low vision, to others with loss of vision in certain areas, such as peripheral vision. In addition, some people may have multiple disabilities.</p></div></div><div id="apddaae65e1b" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Avoid ableist language.</h3><p>Don’t use language that presents people without disabilities as the norm. For example, don’t describe nondisabled people as <em>normal</em>, <em>healthy</em>, <em>regular</em>, or <em>able-bodied</em>. Instead, you can use <em>a person without a disability</em>, <em>a nondisabled person</em>, <em>a neurotypical person</em>, <em>a hearing person</em>, and similar terms.</p></div><p>Avoid treating disability as something to <em>overcome</em>, and don’t describe people with disabilities as <em>brave</em>, <em>courageous</em>, or <em>inspiring</em>, which can come across as condescending.</p></div><div id="apd1fa230eaf" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Avoid language that refers to using specific senses.</h3><p>When writing instructions (such as in training manuals or user guides), avoid using phrases that refer to the use of specific senses, like <em>you see a message</em>, <em>you see a flashing light</em>, or <em>you hear an alert sound</em>. Instead, simply describe what happens: <em>A message appears</em>, <em>a light flashes</em>, <em>an alert sound plays</em>.</p></div><p>Also avoid using idioms that send negative messages about disability—for example, <em>that’s crazy</em>, <em>fell on deaf ears</em>, or <em>turned a blind eye to</em>.</p></div><div id="apda6084f68c" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">Some phrases and idioms are OK.</h3><p>It’s OK to use commonly understood phrases such as the ones below:</p></div><div class="Example"><p>I see your point.</p><p>You can watch your favorite movies on the Apple TV app.</p><p>Hear about the latest news right when it happens.</p><p>Don’t hesitate to speak your mind.</p></div><p>Even if people in your audience can’t see, hear, or speak, they’ll typically understand the intent of the words.</p><p>It’s also OK to use the common cross-reference <em>See</em> when linking to other material (for example, <em>See the Apple Support article “Set up Family Sharing”</em>).</p></div><div id="apd570a90cf4" class="Subhead"><div class="heading-nobreak"><h3 class="Name">A guide to terms about disability</h3><p>Use the table below as a general guide when writing about disability.</p></div><p>In most cases, use identity-first language for people who consider a disability to be part of their identity; otherwise, you can use person-first language. When you’re writing about specific people with disabilities, be sure to find out how they prefer to be identified.</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table data-type="Multicolumn" aria-label="A guide to some of the terms used to write about disabilities"><thead><tr><th scope="col"><p class="TableHead">Identity first</p></th><th scope="col"><p class="TableHead">Person first</p></th><th scope="col"><p class="TableHead">Avoid</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>A disabled person</p><p>Disabled people</p></td><td><p>A person with a disability</p><p>People with disabilities</p></td><td><p>Differently abled</p><p>Special needs</p><p>Special abilities</p><p>Handicapped</p><p>Handicapable</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A blind person</p></td><td><p>A person who is blind</p><p>A person who has low vision</p></td><td><div class="Alert"><p class="Note"><em>Note: </em>Some people may use the term <em>visually impaired</em>.
